# Regex: Matching an Email

Regex for short or regular expression is way to validate certain strings through search patterns. Similar to other methods javascripts has to validate strings like the include method. Regex can be used within functions to help coders check strings that only matches/fulfill their regex. In this file I will be describing and using the regex code snippet known as matching an email.

## Summary

 /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

 Above is a regex code snippet called matching an email, and in the name the purpose of this regex is to accept email that matches with the accepted criteria. In a regex there are multiple factors that go into creating one. Thus, I will try my best to breakdown this code snippet as well as describe the functionality of every part in this regex.
